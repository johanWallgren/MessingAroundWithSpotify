Generate list of song depending on filter options

Code for R.

This will create a tibble with data for all songs by the artists in artistList. 

Edit the list for different artist. The tibble will be saved as artistData.RData.
Move artistData.RData to folder "App".

3.

Load library Shiny with
>library(shiny)
